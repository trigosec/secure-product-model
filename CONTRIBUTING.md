## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Extended version)
- Git
- Basic knowledge of Markdown
- Familiarity with security frameworks (helpful but not required)

### Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/secure-product-framework.git
   cd secure-product-framework
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-contribution
   ```
4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh --serve
   # Or: hugo server -D
   ```

### Making Changes

1. **Content Changes**: Edit Markdown files in the `content/` directory
2. **Design Changes**: Modify CSS in `static/css/style.css`
3. **Template Changes**: Update Hugo templates in `layouts/`
4. **Test Locally**: Always test your changes using `hugo server`

## üìù Content Guidelines

### Security Controls

When adding or modifying security controls:

- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague language like "appropriate security measures"
- **Be Testable**: Controls should be verifiable and measurable
- **Be Practical**: Focus on what engineering teams can actually implement
- **Include Context**: Explain why the control matters and when it applies

### Documentation Style

- **Clear Headings**: Use descriptive, scannable headings
- **Active Voice**: Write in active voice when possible
- **Consistent Terminology**: Use the same terms throughout the model
- **Examples**: Include practical examples wherever helpful

### Markdown Standards

- Use `##` for main sections, `###` for subsections
- Include front matter with title, description, and date
- Use code blocks for technical examples
- Link to related sections using relative URLs

## üîÑ Submission Process

### 1. Pull Request Requirements

- **Clear Description**: Explain what you changed and why
- **Testing**: Confirm the site builds and displays correctly
- **Attribution**: Add yourself to contributors if making significant changes
- **License Agreement**: Confirm you agree to CC BY-SA 4.0 licensing

### 2. Review Process

- All contributions are reviewed for accuracy and clarity
- Security-related changes may require additional expert review
- We aim to provide feedback within 7 days
- Large changes may require discussion before implementation

### 3. Commit Guidelines

- **Descriptive Messages**: Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Logical Commits**: Group related changes into single commits
- **Clean History**: Squash commits if needed before submission

Example commit message:
```
Add ISO 27001 mapping for database encryption controls

- Maps controls C.DB.001-005 to ISO 27001 A.10.1
- Adds implementation guidance for encryption at rest
- Updates cross-reference table in governance section
```

## üß™ Testing Your Changes

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build and serve locally
./deploy.sh --serve

# Build production version
./deploy.sh

# Clean build
./deploy.sh --clean
```

### Content Validation
- Check all internal links work correctly
- Verify markdown renders properly
- Ensure responsive design on mobile
- Test navigation and search functionality

### Security Review
- Security-related content should be reviewed by domain experts
- Control mappings should be verified against official standards
- Implementation guidance should be tested in real environments

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports
- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports
- Include steps to reproduce
- Specify your browser/environment
- Attach screenshots if relevant

### Feature Requests
- Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- Explain how it would benefit users
- Consider implementation complexity
- Be open to alternative solutions
