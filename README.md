# Secure Product Model

A practical security model designed specifically for engineering and technology teams that translates regulatory and governance expectations into actionable, concrete guidance.

## Overview

Unlike traditional control frameworks that are often abstract or high-level, the Secure Product Model provides concrete, actionable guidance directly aligned with how technology organizations operate.

The model is built around **three core elements**:

- **Resources**: Foundational elements subject to control and oversight (29 distinct types)
- **Governance**: Policies, reviews, scoping, and standards that define management processes
- **Controls**: Specific actions, checks, and validations that must be performed

## Why This Model?

Traditional control frameworks often fall short in engineering environments because they lack specificity and practical relevance. This model addresses that gap by:

- **Identifying what needs to be managed** (Resources)
- **Establishing how it should be managed** (Governance)
- **Applying and testing the required practices** (Controls)

## Current Status

- **PCI DSS v4.0.1**: ~90% complete mapping
- **Core Model**: Resources, Governance, and Controls fully defined
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive website with detailed guidance

### Planned Regulatory Mappings

- ISO 27001 - International information security standard
- DORA - EU Digital Operational Resilience Act
- SOC 2 - Service Organization Control 2
- NIS2 - EU Network and Information Systems Directive
- MiCA - EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation

## Website Structure

This Hugo static site includes:

- **Homepage**: Model introduction and overview
- **Model**: Detailed concept explanation and methodology
- **Resources**: 29 resource types with management guidance
- **Governance**: Policies, reviews, scope, and standards
- **Controls**: Security controls organized by category
- **About**: Project roadmap and contribution information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Extended version recommended)
- Git

### Building the Site

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd secure-product-framework
```

2. Build the static site:
```bash
# Using the deployment script (recommended)
./deploy.sh

# Or using Hugo directly
hugo --minify
```

3. Serve locally for development:
```bash
# Using the deployment script
./deploy.sh --serve

# Or using Hugo directly
hugo server -D
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`

### Deployment Script

The included `deploy.sh` script provides convenient build and deployment options:

```bash
./deploy.sh           # Build production site
./deploy.sh --serve   # Start development server
./deploy.sh --clean   # Clean build
./deploy.sh --deploy  # Deploy to production
./deploy.sh --help    # Show all options
```

## Content Organization

### Resources (29 Types)

Infrastructure, application, data, identity & access, physical, and process resources including:
- Cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Compute resources (VMs, containers, serverless)
- Storage systems (databases, file storage, object storage)
- Identity systems (users, RBAC, secrets)
- Development tools (repositories, CI/CD)

### Governance Framework

- **Policies**: Core organizational standards and expectations
- **Reviews**: Scheduled assessments and compliance validation
- **Scope**: Program boundaries and coverage definitions
- **Standards**: Implementation guidance and procedures

### Control Categories

- Account Management (C.Account)
- Authentication (C.Auth)
- Availability (C.Availability)
- Data Protection
- Network Security
- Vulnerability Management
- Incident Response

## Contributing

The Secure Product Model welcomes contributions from:

- Security professionals refining control definitions
- Developers building tooling and integrations
- Compliance experts validating regulatory interpretations
