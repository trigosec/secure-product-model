# Secure Product Model

A practical security model designed specifically for engineering and technology teams that translates regulatory and governance expectations into actionable, concrete guidance.

## Overview

Unlike traditional control frameworks that are often abstract or high-level, the Secure Product Model provides concrete, actionable guidance directly aligned with how technology organizations operate.

The model is built around **three core elements**:

- **Assets**: Foundational elements subject to control and oversight (29 distinct types)
- **Governance**: Policies, reviews, scoping, and standards that define management processes
- **Controls**: Specific actions, checks, and validations that must be performed

## Why This Model?

Traditional control frameworks often fall short in engineering environments because they lack specificity and practical relevance. This model addresses that gap by:

- **Identifying what needs to be managed** (Assets)
- **Establishing how it should be managed** (Governance)
- **Applying and testing the required practices** (Controls)

## Current Status

- **PCI DSS v4.0.1**: ~90% complete mapping
- **Core Model**: Assets, Governance, and Controls fully defined
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive website with detailed guidance

### Planned Regulatory Mappings

- ISO 27001 - International information security standard
- DORA - EU Digital Operational Resilience Act
- SOC 2 - Service Organization Control 2
- NIS2 - EU Network and Information Systems Directive
- MiCA - EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation

## Website Structure

This Hugo static site includes:

- **Homepage**: Model introduction and overview
- **Model**: Detailed concept explanation and methodology
- **Assets**: 29 asset types with management guidance
- **Governance**: Policies, reviews, scope, and standards
- **Controls**: Security controls organized by category
- **About**: Project roadmap and contribution information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Extended version recommended)
- Git

### Building the Site

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd secure-product-framework
```

2. Build the static site:
```bash
# Using the Makefile (recommended)
make build

# Or using Hugo directly
cd website
hugo --minify
```

3. Serve locally for development:
```bash
# Using the Makefile
make serve

# With draft content
make serve-drafts

# Or using Hugo directly
cd website
hugo server -D
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`

### Makefile

The included `Makefile` at the project root provides convenient build and deployment options:

```bash
make build           # Build production site
make serve           # Start development server
make clean-build     # Clean build
make deploy          # Deploy to production
make help            # Show all options
```

## Python Scripts Workflow

The project includes Python utilities to manage and generate website content:

### Data Pipeline

1. **Download from Google Sheets:**
   ```bash
   make data-sync
   ```
   Downloads CSV files to `data/` directory

2. **Convert CSV to YAML:**
   ```bash
   make data-convert
   ```
   Converts CSV files in `data/` to structured YAML

3. **Generate Website Content:**
   ```bash
   make data-generate
   ```
   Creates Hugo pages in `website/content/assets/`

4. **Run complete pipeline:**
   ```bash
   make data-pipeline
   ```
   Runs all three steps in sequence

### Development Environment

Set up development environment:
```bash
# Set up complete development environment
make dev-setup

# Or install Python dependencies manually
pip install -e .    # or: uv pip install -e .
```

## Content Organization

### Assets (29 Types)

Infrastructure, application, data, identity & access, physical, and process assets including:
- Cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Compute resources (VMs, containers, serverless)
- Storage systems (databases, file storage, object storage)
- Identity systems (users, RBAC, secrets)
- Development tools (repositories, CI/CD)

### Governance Framework
