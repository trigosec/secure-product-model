# About the Secure Product Model

The Secure Product Model is an open-source initiative designed to bridge the gap between regulatory compliance requirements and practical implementation in technology organizations. Unlike traditional control frameworks that often remain abstract, this model provides concrete, actionable guidance that aligns with how engineering teams actually work.

## Project Vision

To create a comprehensive, practical security model that:

- **Translates compliance into code**: Makes regulatory requirements actionable for developers
- **Integrates with workflows**: Embeds security into CI/CD pipelines and development processes
- **Provides automation**: Enables automated compliance checking and gap analysis
- **Scales globally**: Supports multiple regulatory frameworks and jurisdictions

## Current Status

The model is actively under development with significant progress:

- **PCI DSS v4.0.1 mapping**: ~90% complete
- **Core model structure**: Resources, Governance, and Controls fully defined
- **29 resource types**: Comprehensive inventory categories established
- **Control categories**: Account, Authentication, Availability, and more

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- âœ… Complete PCI DSS v4.0.1 mapping
- âœ… Establish core model structure
- âœ… Document Resources, Governance, and Controls
- ðŸ”„ Build static website and documentation

### Phase 2: Expansion
- ðŸ“‹ ISO 27001 mapping
- ðŸ“‹ DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) mapping
- ðŸ“‹ SOC 2 Type II mapping
- ðŸ“‹ NIS2 (Network and Information Systems Directive) mapping
- ðŸ“‹ MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) mapping

### Phase 3: Tooling
- ðŸ“‹ Developer CLI tools for control validation
- ðŸ“‹ CI/CD pipeline integrations
- ðŸ“‹ Infrastructure-as-Code compliance checking
- ðŸ“‹ Automated gap analysis tools

### Phase 4: Platform
- ðŸ“‹ Web-based compliance dashboard
- ðŸ“‹ Multi-framework traceability
- ðŸ“‹ AI-assisted policy generation
- ðŸ“‹ Continuous compliance monitoring

## Approach to Market

### Open Source Foundation
The core model and control definitions will remain **publicly available** to ensure:
- Community contributions and improvements
- Transparency in compliance interpretation
- Widespread adoption and standardization
- Academic and research use

### Value-Added Services

**Regulatory Mappings** (Paid)
- Detailed mappings to specific standards and regulations
- Regular updates as regulations evolve
- Gap analysis and compliance traceability
- Billing model: To be determined (one-time vs. subscription)

**AI-Assisted Policy Development** (Premium)
- Automated policy draft generation
- Multi-framework compliance verification
- Regulatory change impact analysis
- Example: Update Business Continuity Policy to comply with both DORA and ISO 27001

### Developer-First Approach

**Integration Focus**
- Command-line tools for developers
- IDE extensions and plugins
- Git hooks for compliance validation
- API-first design for custom integrations

**Workflow Embedding**
- Infrastructure design guidance
- Real-time compliance feedback
- Automated remediation suggestions
- Security-by-design principles

## Use Cases

### For Developers
- Look up security requirements when building infrastructure
- Validate compliance during development
- Integrate security checks into CI/CD pipelines
- Automate security documentation

### For Compliance Teams
- Map regulatory requirements to technical controls
- Generate automated gap analyses
- Maintain compliance across multiple frameworks
- Demonstrate audit readiness

### For Organizations
- Standardize security practices across teams
- Reduce compliance overhead and costs
- Improve security posture systematically
- Enable risk-based decision making

## Contributing

The Secure Product Model welcomes contributions from:

- **Security professionals**: Refining control definitions and mappings
- **Developers**: Building tooling and integrations
- **Compliance experts**: Validating regulatory interpretations
- **Organizations**: Sharing implementation experiences

### Ways to Contribute
- Review and improve control definitions
- Add new regulatory mappings
- Build developer tools and integrations
- Provide feedback on framework usability
- Share implementation case studies

## Technology Stack

**Website and Documentation**
- Hugo static site generator
- Markdown content management
- Responsive design for mobile access
- Search and navigation optimization

**Future Tooling**
- Go/Rust for CLI tools (performance-focused)
- Python for AI/ML components
- TypeScript for web interfaces
- Infrastructure-as-Code integrations

## Contact and Community

- **Website**: [secure-product-model.org](https://secure-product-model.org)
- **GitHub**: Framework source code and issue tracking
- **Discussions**: Community forums and Q&A
- **Updates**: Newsletter and release announcements

## License

The core model is released under an open-source license to ensure:
- Free access to fundamental security guidance
- Community-driven improvement and validation
- Transparency in compliance interpretation
- Educational and research use support

Premium mappings and AI-assisted services operate under separate commercial licensing to support ongoing development and maintenance.
